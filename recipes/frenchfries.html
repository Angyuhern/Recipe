<h2>Description</h2>
<p>French fries, chips, finger chips, French-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes, originating from either Belgium or France. They are prepared by cutting the potato into even strips, then drying and frying it, usually in a deep fryer.

<h2>Ingredient</h2>
<ul>
    <li>10 large russet potatoes, peeled and rinsed</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>2 quarts vegetable oil, can sub canola oil</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Slice the potatoes into ½ inch thick sticks. Using a French fry cutter makes this much easier.</li>
    <li>Soak the potato slices in cold water for a minimum of one hour, and up to overnight. The longer, the better as this process removes the starch which makes for extra crispy fries.</li>
    <li>Rinse the fries twice with cold water.</li>
    <li>Lay the fries on paper towels or a clean dishcloth and pat them as dry as possible.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or dutch oven to 300 degrees F. You’ll need to fry in about six batches, begin with a quart of oil and add more as needed. Frying too many at once makes them less crispy.</li>
    <li>Use a slotted spoon to add the potatoes to the oil and fry for about 5-6 minutes. The oil should bubble lightly, we’re only heating the potatoes, we don’t want them to crisp yet.</li>
    <li>Place the cooked potatoes on a paper towel lined plate and fry the rest of the remaining batches.</li>
    <li>Increase the heat to 400 degrees F and fry each batch a second time until they are crisp and golden-brown, about 5 minutes or so.</li>
    <li>Remove them and place them on dry paper towels. Sprinkle with salt as soon as they come out.</li>
    <li>Serve with ketchup or fry sauce and enjoy!</li>
